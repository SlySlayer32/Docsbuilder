# User-Friendly Documentation Guide

## The "10-Year-Old Test"

All documentation generated by Docsbuilder must be clear enough that a bright 10-year-old could follow it. This doesn't mean dumbing down - it means explaining everything clearly without assumptions.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Explain Every Technical Term**
‚ùå **Bad**: "Configure your API endpoint"
‚úÖ **Good**: "Configure your API endpoint (the web address where your app sends and receives data)"

### 2. **Provide Success Indicators**
Every step must include a way to verify it worked:

```markdown
### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install
```

**‚úÖ Success Check**: You should see "added XXX packages" without any red error messages.

**‚ùå If you see errors**: Check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.
```

### 3. **Use Progressive Disclosure**
Start simple, then add details:

```markdown
## Quick Start (5 minutes)
[Simple steps to get running]

## Detailed Setup (15 minutes)
[Complete explanation with all options]

## Advanced Configuration
[For power users who need customization]
```

### 4. **Show, Don't Just Tell**
Always include examples:

```markdown
‚ùå **Bad**: "Set your environment variables"

‚úÖ **Good**: 
```bash
# Copy this file
cp .env.example .env

# Then edit .env and add your values:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
```

### 5. **Comprehensive Troubleshooting**
Every common error needs a solution:

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to database"

**Cause**: Your database isn't running or the connection details are wrong.

**Solution**:
1. Check if PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
2. Verify your DATABASE_URL in `.env` matches your database
3. Make sure your database user has the right permissions

# Complete Setup Guide

## What You Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** (check with `node --version`)
  - Don't have it? [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **PostgreSQL 14+** (check with `psql --version`)
  - Don't have it? [Install PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/download)
- **A Stripe account** (for payments)
  - Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)

**Time Required**: About 15 minutes

---

## Step 1: Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

‚úÖ **Success**: You should see the project files when you run `ls`

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

‚úÖ **Success**: You should see "added XXX packages in XXs"

‚ùå **Errors?** See [Dependency Troubleshooting](#dependency-issues)

---

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables are secret settings your app needs (like passwords and API keys).

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with your settings**:
   ```bash
   # Database connection
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
   
   # Stripe payment keys (get from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   
   # Session secret (any random string)
   SESSION_SECRET=make-this-a-long-random-string
   ```

‚úÖ **Success**: Your `.env` file should have real values, not placeholders

**Where to find these values**:
- Database URL: [Guide to PostgreSQL URLs](link)
- Stripe keys: Log into Stripe ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API keys
- Session secret: Any random string (32+ characters recommended)

---

## Step 4: Create the Database

```bash
npm run db:create
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

**What this does**:
- `db:create`: Makes a new database
- `db:migrate`: Sets up the tables and structure
- `db:seed`: Adds sample data for testing

‚úÖ **Success**: You should see "Database ready" and no errors

‚ùå **Errors?** See [Database Troubleshooting](#database-issues)

---

## Step 5: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

‚úÖ **Success**: 
- You should see "Server running on http://localhost:3000"
- Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- You should see the home page

üéâ **You're done!** The app is running.

## Troubleshooting

### Dependency Issues

**"npm install failed"**

Try these solutions in order:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again
2. Update npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`
3. Use a different Node version: [Install nvm](link) and try Node 18

---

### Database Issues

**"Cannot connect to database"**

1. **Is PostgreSQL running?**
   ```bash
   pg_isready
   ```
   Should say "accepting connections"

2. **Is your DATABASE_URL correct?**
   Format: `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name`

3. **Does the database exist?**
   ```bash
   psql -l
   ```
   Should list your database

**"Migration failed"**

1. Drop and recreate the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:drop
   npm run db:create
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

---

### Port Already in Use

**"Port 3000 is already in use"**

1. **Find what's using it**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   ```

2. **Kill that process**:
   ```bash
   kill -9 [PID]
   ```

3. **Or use a different port**:
   ```bash
   PORT=3001 npm run dev
   ```

---

## Quality Score Calculation

Documentation quality is scored 0-100:

- **Clarity** (25 points): No jargon, simple language, clear structure
- **Completeness** (25 points): All steps, all terms, all configs
- **Verifiability** (20 points): Success checks, troubleshooting, error handling
- **Examples** (15 points): Working code, realistic data, multiple scenarios
- **Organization** (15 points): Logical flow, good navigation, scannable

**Target**: 90+ points for all generated documentation

---

## Integration Between Components

When multiple components are selected, documentation must explain:

1. **How they work together**: Simple diagram or explanation
2. **Setup order**: Which to configure first and why
3. **Shared configuration**: Variables or settings used by multiple components
4. **Testing integration**: How to verify components work together

Example:
```markdown
## How Authentication and Payments Work Together

When a user makes a payment, the system needs to know who they are. Here's how it works:

1. User logs in (Authentication component)
2. User's session is created with their user ID
3. User clicks "Subscribe" (Payment component)
4. Payment component uses the user ID from the session
5. Subscription is linked to that user in the database

**Testing**: 
1. Log in as a test user
2. Go to the payment page
3. Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
4. Check your dashboard - subscription should show up
```

---

## Template Variables

Documentation templates can use these variables:

- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`: The user's project name
- `{{TECH_STACK.frontend}}`: Selected frontend (e.g., "React")
- `{{TECH_STACK.backend}}`: Selected backend (e.g., "Node.js")
- `{{TECH_STACK.database}}`: Selected database (e.g., "PostgreSQL")
- `{{COMPONENTS}}`: List of selected components
- `{{PORT}}`: Default port (usually 3000)

These are replaced during generation with actual values.

---

## Review Checklist

Before finalizing generated documentation:

### For Each File:
- [ ] Read it aloud - does it sound natural?
- [ ] Try to follow the steps - can you complete them?
- [ ] Look for assumptions - are any unstated?
- [ ] Check for jargon - is every term explained?
- [ ] Verify links - do they all work?

### For the Complete Set:
- [ ] Is there a clear starting point?
- [ ] Can you navigate between docs easily?
- [ ] Is troubleshooting comprehensive?
- [ ] Are success indicators clear?
- [ ] Could a beginner follow this?

---

## Continuous Improvement

Documentation quality improves through:

1. **User Feedback**: Track where users get stuck
2. **Error Patterns**: Monitor common errors and add solutions
3. **Template Updates**: Regularly improve templates based on feedback
4. **Validation Metrics**: Track quality scores and improve
5. **Community Contributions**: Accept improvements from users

---

**Remember**: If you have to explain it to the user after they read the docs, the docs failed. Make them foolproof.
